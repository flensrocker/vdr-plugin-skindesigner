Description
-----------

Library which provides the Skindesigner API to other Plugins. Plugins using
this API are able to use all Skindesigner facilities to display their OSD
representation.

Thanks @ Lars Hanisch for providing an exemplarily implementation on which
the code of this library is based on.  

Installation
------------

cd <PLUGINSOURCEDIR>/libskindesignerapi
make clean
make install

After installation check if libskindesignerapi.pc is correctly found in your
PKG_CONFIG_PATH. If not, you should do something like this in your .bashrc:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
